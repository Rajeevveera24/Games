# Games

These games were made in a team, for a school exhibition. They are all designed in turbo c++ (It was taught at my school back then)
It was the first time that I worked with the graphics.h library of turbo c++

The program has three games: tic tac toe, catch 22 (based on pacman) and flappy fish (based on flappy bird)

The program explains how to play these games. To play the tic toe game, you have to press numbers from one to nine to fill the respective squares

To run the program, turbo c++ must first be installed, and the egavga.bgi file must be included in the directory where the program file is kept.
